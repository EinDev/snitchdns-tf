# Terraform Development Overrides Configuration
#
# This file allows you to use a locally built provider instead of downloading
# from the Terraform Registry. This is useful for development and testing.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Build and install the provider locally:
#      make install
#
#   2. Copy this file to your home directory:
#      cp .terraformrc.example ~/.terraformrc
#
#   3. Update the path below to match your system
#
#   4. Run terraform commands as normal:
#      cd examples/basic
#      terraform init
#      terraform plan
#
# IMPORTANT: With dev_overrides enabled, Terraform will skip version checks
# and use your local build instead. Remove or comment out this configuration
# when you want to use the published provider from the registry.

provider_installation {
  # Use the locally built provider instead of downloading from the registry
  dev_overrides {
    "registry.terraform.io/EinDev/snitchdns" = "/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/EinDev/snitchdns/dev/linux_amd64"
  }

  # For all other providers, use the registry directly
  direct {}
}

# Platform-specific paths:
#
# Linux:   ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/EinDev/snitchdns/dev/linux_amd64
# macOS:   ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/EinDev/snitchdns/dev/darwin_amd64
# Windows: %APPDATA%/terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/EinDev/snitchdns/dev/windows_amd64
#
# The exact path is shown after running `make install`
